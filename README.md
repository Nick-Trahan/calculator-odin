# calculator-odin
The Odin Project - JavaScript Basics final project. 

This is a basic (one operation at a time) calculator build using HTML, CSS and
JavaScript.

## Features include:
- A two-tier, 15 character display (Live input at the bottom and a log of the
  current operation up top.)
- Rounds floating-point numbers to two decimal points.
- Seamless chaining of operations without having to press the equals key.
- A backspace button to undo the last input.
- A "clear" button to start over.
- Keyboard support! (Number, operator, and backspace keys work as expected.
  Esc will clear all and Del is another option for backspace.)
- Error checking. (It really doesn't like it when you try to divide by zero.)
- An immature sense of humor, but it's trying to keep it professional.
- Is (probably) not evil.
